You decide how much you want to charge per night for your property. To get an idea of what you can charge, we recommend that you search similar listings in your neighborhood to learn more about the local pricing. The quality of accommodations, amenities, size, number of rooms and the neighborhood in which the property is located are the important criteria, which would affect your nightly rate.  Keep in mind, in order to have more bookings and attract more Guests the price per night should be comparable to other similar properties in the same area. Also, you should set different rates for weekends and holidays.

We recommend choosing an attractive title which informs potential Guest about the location and the main highlight of your property and writing a detailed and accurate description that showcases everything your property has to offer to your potential Guests. It is important that the information about your rental is sufficient to give a prospective Guest a sense of what it would be like to stay at your property. In addition to the property details, you should describe your local area, some of the interesting things to do in the neighborhood, and any other unique features that make your place stand out from the rest. In advertising your property you must adhere to the <a href="">Property Owner's Policy</a>, and provide the Guest with clear and detailed rules as to the check-in and check-out, <a href="">Security Deposit</a> and <a href="">Cancellation</a> Policy. This information, along with good reviews, will help Guest notice your rental and put it at the top of their list.

When listing your property with Squaredoor, you are required to adhere to the <a href="">Property Owner’s Policy</a>. As a Property Owner, you have the ability to set many of the rules and restrictions related to the use of your property by the prospective Guest. It is important that you conduct the necessary research and seek legal advice as well as other professional advice in order to make sure that you and your property comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations for your country, state, city and your local area and community. It is important that you treat your Guests as friends, and make sure that each of your Guests has a great experience staying in your vacation rental. If you provide a clean, safe, comfortable and enjoyable accommodation for your Guests, and inform them clearly and upfront about anything that may be important and helpful for them to know about your property, you will ensure that your Guests have great experience.  In turn, your efforts will be repaid with great reviews and references.

When listing a property with Squaredoor you have the option to set a cleaning fee and charge a one time cleaning fee per service. Property Owners can offer a Guest an option to select more than one cleaning fee depending on the duration of the stay. The first cleaning fee is non-refundable once the Guest has checked-in. However, if the rental reservation was canceled prior to the check-in, the cleaning fee is refunded in full, regardless of other restrictions imposed by the <a href="">Cancellation Policy</a>.

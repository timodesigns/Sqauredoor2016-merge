<h4>PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND NON INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF </h4>
<p>You and Company agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the Arbitrator may not consolidate nor join more than one person's or party's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. The Arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party and only to the extent necessary to provide relief for that party's individual claims. Any relief awarded cannot affect other users of Company Services .</p>
<hr>
<h4>ARBITRATION PROCEDURES </h4>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator also must follow the terms of these Terms and Conditions as a court would .</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of these Terms and Conditions including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or Terms and Conditions is void or voidable. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its rules and procedures, including the American Arbitration Association Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, as applicable, and as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The arbitration shall be held at a mutually agreed location .</p>

<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users of Company Services, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user of Company Services to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof .</p>

<h4>COSTS OF ARBITRATION </h4>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the American Arbitration Association's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate .</p>
